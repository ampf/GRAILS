APPSCIO LARGE DATA EVALUATOR v1.0
---------------------------------

(c) Appscio, Inc. 2010

The Large Data Evaluator is a web application that allows you to view performance data
from Appscio's MPF event detectors and run new detector tasks.

To run the application with a sample database containing analysis data from tests run
by Appscio, simply type:

./start

from this directory.  The LDE URL defaults to:

http://localhost:28080/LDE

The port number and other parameters may be overridden; see the comments in the
start script for details.

To view analysis details comparing multiple Appscio detectors against a set of test
UAV videos, click the Analysis button.

To view a list of the event detection tasks, click the List Tasks button and 
specify the task details:

1. Name the MpfTask (any name you like)
2. Select the MppMpfDetector from the Detector drop-down
3. Identify the detection you want to do, by entering into the 'Detector prefix'' one of the following:
       detector=detect-md.sh (this is the default if Detector Prefix is left blank), or
       detector=detect-usc.sh or
       detector=detect-md-usc.sh
4. Put the video URL into the ''Video File Url'' field
5. Change the Timeout; the required time varies with the video, the detector, and your hardware
6. Click on Create to submit the job (it will run immediately)
7. Check the List Tasks view periodically to see how the task is doing (it should be in RUNNING status,
   then transition into SUCCEEDED or FAILED); at any time, check the Analysis view to get measurements 
   on any completed evaluations.
